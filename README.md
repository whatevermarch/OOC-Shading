# Out-of-core Shading
This project is to migrate shader resources (texture, etc.) between host and device (GPU) for extended memory space by taking advantage of [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/)'s memory management ability.

### WARNING!! 
This project is **IN PROGRESS**. I push the code to GitHub just to backup, so I won't guarantee what will happen to your device if you pull this repo to test right now. ;)
