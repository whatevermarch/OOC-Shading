# Out-of-core Shading
This project is to migrate shader resources (texture, etc.) between host and device (GPU) for extended memory space by taking advantage of [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/)'s memory management ability.

### WARNING!! 
This project is **IN PROGRESS**. I push the code to GitHub just to backup, so I won't guarantee what will happen to your device if you pull this repo to test right now. ;)

## Tools
- [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) (for sure)
- [AMD's Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/vulkan-memory-allocator/) (that default pool is like .. Oh My God)
- [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/)
- [GLFW](www.glfw.org/)

### Special Thanks
If there ain't no [Sascha Willems's sample](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan) and [Alexander Overvoorde's tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/), I would have got no life till now for sure. LOL
